# Programming for Data Science with Python
## About this Repository
This repository contains three projects, in which I learn about SQL (PostgreSQL), Python, Command line environment (GITBASH) and GIT.
* SQL => JOINS, Aggregations, subqueries and complex business problems.
* Python => Data Structure, Variables, loops and functions , libraries (Numpy, pandas)
* Git version control => Upload the files using command line, working with remote repository

## Project 1

## Overview

This project is about the exploration of database, understand the diffent tables and their relationship with each others, and write queries from given questions and then create visualizations to better understand the student's queries. Find the dataase here: (POSTGRESQL documentation sample database): https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/
* A set of questions have also been provided by Udacity so that we were free to consider and include them in our Project Submission. Find it in between the comments: Project1/SQL.txt

## Project 2

## Overview
In this project, the student had to make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The student had to write code to (a) import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics, and (b) write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## Project Submission

The developed CLI program allows the user to explore an US bikeshare system database and retrieve statistics information from the database. The user is able filter the information by city, month and weekday, in order to visualize statistics information related to a specific subset of data. The user is also able to chose to view raw data and to sort this data by columns, in ascending or descending order. Basically, I created an interactive experience in the terminal that presents the answers of the given questions.

### Files used

The required files for running this program are:

* washington.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* chicago.csv
